            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is fractal wood burning?</h3>
            <p>Fractal wood burning, also known as Lichtenberg burning, involves using high-voltage electricity to create unique, tree-like patterns in the wood. Each piece is one-of-a-kind and showcases the natural beauty of the wood.</p>
            <h3>How do you ensure your materials are eco-friendly?</h3>
            <p>We source our wood from sustainable suppliers and use non-toxic, eco-friendly resins in our creations. Our commitment to the environment is a core part of our business.</p>
